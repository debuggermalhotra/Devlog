* Previously I was having trouble with rendering a vega-view onto a sample webpage using Vega.embed, but now that issue has been sorted out and this is what I am getting:
<img src="images/view1.png" style="width: 100%">
* Of course, there is no histogram right now, but al least I know that a vega-view has been created and I just need to focus on my histogram.
