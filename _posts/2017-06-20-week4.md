1. Got more info. about the web plotting fundamentals to be used by viewing: [hgwebplot](https://github.com/lukasheinrich/hgwebplot) by Mr. Lukas Heinrich[https://github.com/lukasheinrich]
2. Had a skype meet with both the mentors discussing my progress and much more.
3. Now working on translating json from Bin primitive in test.py to json reasy to be paresd by vega
4. As of now, a simple bar chart with the data:
' "data": [
    {
      "name": "table",
      "values": [
        {"category": "A", "amount": 28},
        {"category": "B", "amount": 55},
        {"category": "C", "amount": 43},
        {"category": "D", "amount": 91},
        {"category": "E", "amount": 81},
        {"category": "F", "amount": 53},
        {"category": "G", "amount": 19},
        {"category": "H", "amount": 87}
      ]
    }
  ] '
  looks like:
  ![barchart1](https://github.com/debuggermalhotra/gsocdevlog/blob/gh-pages/images/barchart1.png)
  
  and a histogram without a data will look like:
  ![histogram1](https://github.com/debuggermalhotra/gsocdevlog/blob/gh-pages/images/histogram1.png)
