1. Data loaded into a vega specification, but not able to transform it. Though I am using Bin transform property that is clearly used to define Histograms, but still confused how to define 'feild' parameter for my test data.
2. Currently i have loaded data directly into the specification as "data":[{"values": [89.0,
      100.0,
      101.0,
      95.0,
      85.0,
      111.0,
      101.0,
      104.0,
      96.0,
      105.0,
      102.0,
      96.0,
      91.0,
      111.0,
      108.0,
      100.0,
      111.0,
      93.0,
      104.0,
      97.0]}] but I think for the translations the best approach is to load the data using "url" property and then access the bin values.
