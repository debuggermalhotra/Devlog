* I think I'm stuck with wether i should first start describing the signals[] property and data[] properties. Ok, i'm moving with data[], first because that's how i am gonna transform values of each bin. 

* Iterating through the API docs of Vega I'm confused between what exactly is the difference between Vega.parse() which takes the vega runtime as an arguement and Vega.View(which i have already used with vega embed and i am already able to render a barchart/histogram in the browser). I am going to ask about this to <a src="https://github.com/domoritz"> Dominik moritz(one of the authors of Vega)</a> about this.

* Problem solved-> I do not need to use Vega.parse() if i'm using vega.embed to render a plot. 

* Hmm, I cannot understand what's the difference between a Histgram and a Histogram with Null values and vega example-page describes both of them. and there are two types of sliders viz binOffSet and binStep in this example which i am not sure about what they are doing exactly. Ok, i think i have to ask my mentors.
