1. I think I'm stuck with wether i should first start describing the signals[] property and data[] properties. Ok, i'm moving with data[], first because that's how i am gonna transform values of each bin. 
2. Iterating through the API docs of Vega 'm confused between what exactly is teh difference between Vega.parse() which takes the vega runtime as an arguement and Vega.View(which i have already used with vega embed and i am already able to render a barchart/histogram in the browser. I am going to ask about this to Dominik moritz about this(one of the authors of Vega).
3. Problem solved-> I do not need to use Vega.parse() if i'm using vega.embed to render a plot.  
4. Hmm, I cnanot understand what's the difference between a Histgram and a Histogram with Null values and vega example-page describes both of them. and there are two types of sliders viz binOffSet and binStep in this example which i am not sure about what they are doing exactly. Ok, i think i have to ask my mentors.
