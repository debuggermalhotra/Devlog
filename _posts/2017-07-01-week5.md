* Now when defining scales, I have to describe four things:
* 1. Scale Properties: <https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/scales/#properties>
* 2. Scale Types: <https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/scales/#types>
* 3. Scale Domains: <https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/scales/#domain>
* 4. Scale Ranges: <https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/scales/#range>

* I am confused wether my histogram type should be linear or any other type. Let me ask the vega author about this doubt.
* Meanwhile I have defined the domain of my scale as [85,115] as these are the lowest and highest entries and range="width" for xscale and range="height" for yscale.
