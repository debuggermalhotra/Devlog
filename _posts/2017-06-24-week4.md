 1. Found about this great tool [jsonviewer](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) used to format json and view it in an organized way.
 2. Was running into issues by trying to create a histogram from a described example based on pretty large data(data source: IMDB) because the data transformations and signals.
 3. Now moving to the phase where I iterate through each property of vega specifications so that the signals, data transformations like Bin and aggregate can be according to my test.json
 #### Basically this is what a raw Vega specification looks like:
 >{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega/v3.0.json",
  "description": "A specification outline example.",
  "width": 500,
  "height": 200,
  "padding": 5,
  "autosize": "pad",

> "signals": [],
  "data": [],
  "scales": [],
  "projections": [],
  "axes": [],
  "legends": [],
  "marks": []
}
