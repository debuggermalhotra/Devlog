 1. Found about this great tool [jsonviewer](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) used to format json and view it in an organized way.
 2. Was running into issues by trying to create a histogram from a described example based on pretty large data(data source: IMDB) because the data transformations and signals.
 3. Now moving to the phase where I iterate through each property of vega specifications so that the signals, data transformations like Bin and aggregate can be according to my test.json
 4. Basically this is what a raw Vega specification looks like:

  1. {
  2. "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega/v3.0.json",
  3. "description": "A specification outline example.",
  4. "width": 500,
  5. "height": 200,
  6. "padding": 5,
  7. "autosize": "pad",

 1. "signals": [],
 2. "data": [],
 3. "scales": [],
 4.  "projections": [],
 5.  "axes": [],
 6.  "legends": [],
 7.  "marks": []
 8. }
