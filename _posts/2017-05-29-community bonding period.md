# *"The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures."*

### The above quote is by Mike Bostock, the creator of D3.js and D3.express and it is as true and veracious as it sounds. Hope my project does justice to this saying!

#### Community bonding period(4th May - 29th may) has finally come to an end and Coding Period has started. A lot of things happened over this span of time. It all started with my mentor adding to me the Slack channels of Histogrammar and Scikit-HEP. Two Telegram groups were formed, one for GSOC-selected students and one for students working under CERN-HSF. We bonded, we shared our problems, we discussed solutions to those problems, we moved on.

#### Though I was busy with my end-semester exams from 8th may to 18th may, time period from 18th to 29th was felt enough to dive into the codebase and community workflows. I read the docs, hopped on some tutorials, got introduced to some great names who are helping to make Data visualizations better and better like Edward Tufte, Mike Bostock. Both of my mentors were really helpful and we had a skype conference, discussing our further plans and deliverables. 
#### I came across some interesting facts like:

> Until know,for me there was only one type of 1D histogram that is used for binning data, but there are actually many types of histograms like:
1. 2D histograms
2. Profile histograms
3. Efficiency plots (derived from two histograms)
4. Bundles of histograms (groups of related histograms)
5. tacked histograms and many more.
> Another fact was about physicists and analysts, that they make around 6 plots per minute; Ah! that's a responsibility. 

> Visualization can be beautiful, but they have to be practical and flexible.

> Visualizations tools do need interactivity but over-the-top animations like effects and events triggered by hovering should be avoided.

#### Some of the tools/softwares/packages/libraries I'll be working with this summer :
1. Histogrammar: Histogrammar is a suite of data aggregation primitives for making histograms and much, much more.
2. Vega: A visualisation grammar, a declarative language for saving and sharing interactive visualisation designs. Fun fact: it is built on top of D3.js
4. WSGI: It is an interface specification by which server and application communicate.

###### *Note: Some of the libraries mentioned above are language-specific i.e. what lead to the epiphany and idea of my project.
