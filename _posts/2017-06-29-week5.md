* I made a mistake: I followed a greedy approach to load and declare the data first and start with the transform of already aggregate data
* I am going to define every property in the order as defined in the [vega-specification example file)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/histogrammar/histogrammar-python/vega/histogrammar/plot/vega/vega-spec.json]
* Starting of with "signals[]" property:
*  Signals are dynamic variables that parameterize a visualization and can drive interactive behaviors. Signals can be used throughout a Vega specification, for example to define a mark property or data transform parameter.
* E.g in my case, for a 1D-Histogram we can add binOffset and binStep like this:
![Signal]()
<br>

* But these are options slider bar defaults that let us re-bin the data on the fly. Since our data will already be in histogram forms, I won't use this functionality of vega as of now.
