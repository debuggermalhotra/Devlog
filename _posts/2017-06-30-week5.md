* Managing my directories, I got the chance to represent what's going under the hood through png. Hope it is pretty clear from the image itself. Moving on the translator.js is loading my test.json file from github servers instead of local directory. Also I am using JQuery now instead of XMLHTTPrequest() of plain javascript as the later was returning issues with MIME type.
>$.getJSON("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/histogrammar/histogrammar-python/vega/histogrammar/plot/vega/test/test.json", function(json) {
    console.log(json);
});
* All the translations and manipulations will be written inside this function
